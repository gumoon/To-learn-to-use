# Introduction
Sketch is a vector drawing app intended for designers of all sorts. Vector-based drawing is by far the best way to design websites, icons or interfaces. On top of this vector editing we have added support for basic bitmap styles, such as blur and color corrections.
> Sketch 是一个为所有设计师设计的绘制矢量图形的APP。基于矢量的绘制，是迄今为止设计网站、图标、界面最好的的方式。在矢量之上，我们支持基本的位图样式，像模糊和颜色校正。

We’ve made Sketch both powerful and easy to understand. Experienced designers can easily transfer their existing skills in a matter of hours, and replace Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator or Fireworks for most digital design tasks.

## Why use Sketch

Sketch has a great UI and was built for the kind of things you want to do when you design icons or interfaces. It’s a one-window app, and what you need is always in reach. We support Multiple Fills per layer and we have the best text rendering and text styles out there. The canvas is infinite and we have some great asset exporting tools we’re sure you will love.

You can view the canvas both in a resolution-independent view where you have infinite precision, or you can turn on Pixel Preview and you will know exactly how every pixel will look on export - if you care about such a thing.

## What Sketch is not

Sketch is not a bitmap editor. This means that if you want to do photo correction or draw with brushes, this is not the app for you.
> Sketch 不是一个位图编辑器。这意味着如果你想修图或者使用画笔画画，它不是你想要的。
